# Skin Disease Classifier
### Overview
Skin diseases are prevalent globally, affecting millions each year. Early and precise detection is crucial for effective treatment and patient management. This project introduces an automated system that leverages the HAM10000 dataset, a comprehensive collection of dermatoscopic images, to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of skin diseases. By developing a deep learning model capable of detecting and classifying various skin lesions with high accuracy.
